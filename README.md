# NLP2020

Coding exercises for the NLP course


The repo is structured in the following way:
* Two outer folders, A1 and A2, grouping the exercises regarding the two different assignment parts.
* One folder for each exercise. In particular, if the exercise was splitted in subsection, there is a fodler for each of them (e.g., Q3-A and Q3-B)
